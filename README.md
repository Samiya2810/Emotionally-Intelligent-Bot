## Emotionally Intelligent Bot

Welcome to the Emotionally Intelligent Bot repository! This project aims to develop a chatbot with emotional intelligence capabilities, enhancing user experience and engagement through sentiment analysis and appropriate response generation.

### Overview
The Emotionally Intelligent Bot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze user input text and infer emotions. Based on the detected sentiment, the bot provides contextually relevant responses to foster interactive communication.

### Features
- Sentiment Analysis: The bot analyzes user input text to determine sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
- Contextual Response Generation: Responses are tailored to the predicted sentiment, enriching user interaction.
- User Engagement: Emotionally intelligent responses enhance user engagement and satisfaction.
- Continuous Improvement: Real-time feedback collection and model iteration ensure ongoing enhancement.

### Installation
